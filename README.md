A handy dandy app for showing you your daily timetable and counting down the minutes.

## Installation Guide
This app doesn't come packaged (i.e. with an .exe or an installer), so you're gonna have to install it manually. Here's how:
1. Click on the green button near the top of the page that says code, and click "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the folder to wherever you'd like.
3. Open the unzipped folder, click on the address bar, and type "cmd". This will open command prompt.
4. Type "npm install". This will install all the dependencies for the app, which you'll need. This may take upwards of a couple minutes.
5. Go to your Sentral page and export your timetable as an .ics file.
6. Place it inside the "timetables" folder inside the app directory, making sure it is named "my_timetable.ics".

## How to Run
1. Type cmd in the address bar of the apps root directory.
2. Type "npm run start". The window will open after a few seconds.
3. Click "load timetable".
4. Check if the periods you see correspond to the correct week; if not, click "change week".
5. Profit
